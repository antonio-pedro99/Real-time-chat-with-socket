# Real time chat with socket in C

I used to socket() to implement real time chat that run with two c programs. 
Socket is one of the byte stream data transfers comunitation facility available in Unix like operating System. Each read operation may read an arbitrary number of bytes from the IPC facility, regardless of the size of blocks written by the writer.

I have create one socket to read and and to write.
